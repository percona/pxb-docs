Percona XtraBackup copies the InnoDB data files, which results in data that is internally inconsistent; then the <code>prepare</code> phase performs crash recovery on the files to make a consistent, usable database again.</p> <p>The <code>--prepare</code> phase has the following operations:</p> <ul> <li>Applies the redo log</li> <li>Applies the undo log</li> </ul> <p>As a physical operation, the changes from the redo log modifications are applied to a page. In the redo log operation, there is no concept of row or transaction. The redo apply operation does not make the database consistent with a transaction. An uncommitted transaction can be flushed or written to the redo log by the server. Percona XtraBackup applies changes recorded in the redo log.</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup physically modifies a specific offset of a page within a tablespace (IBD file) when applying a redo log. </p> <p>As a logical operation, Percona XtraBackup applies the undo log on a specific row.

Percona XtraBackup uses this <code>table_id</code> to find the table definition, and then uses that information to parse the records on an index page. The transaction rollback reads the undo log records and applies the changes. </p> <p>After initializing the data dictionary engine and the data dictionary cache, the storage engine can request the <code>table_id</code> and uses this ID to fetch the table schema. An index search tuple (key) is created from the table schema and key fields from the undo log record. The server finds the record using the search tuple (key) and performs the undo operation.</p> <p>For example, InnoDB uses the <code>table_id</code> (also known as the <code>se_private_id</code>) for a table definition. Percona XtraBackup does not behave like a server and does not have access to the data dictionary. XtraBackup initializes the InnoDB engine and uses the <code>InnoDB table object</code> (<code>dict_table_t</code>) when needed. XtraBackup relies on Serialized Dictionary Information (SDI) that is stored in the tablespace. SDI is a JSON representation of a table.</p> <p>In Percona XtraBackup 8.2.0-1, tables are loaded as <code>evictable</code>. XtraBackup scans the B-tree index of the data dictionary tables <code>mysql.indexes</code> and <code>mysql.index_partitions</code> to establish a relationship between the <code>table_id</code> and the <code>tablespace(space_id)</code>. XtraBackup uses this relationship during transaction rollback. XtraBackup does not load user tables unless there is a transaction rollback on them.</p> <p>A background thread or a Percona XtraBackup main thread handles the cache eviction when the cache size limit is reached.</p> <p>This  design provides the following benefits during the <code>--prepare</code> phase:</p> <ul> <li>Uses less memory</li> <li>Uses less IO</li> <li>Improves the time taken in the <code>--prepare</code> phase</li> <li>Completes successfully, even if the <code>--prepare</code> phase has a huge number of tables</li> <li>Completes the Percona XtraDB Cluster SST process faster</li> </ul>"},{"location":"dictionary-cache.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"docker.html","title":"Run a Docker container","text":"<p>Docker allows you to run applications in a lightweight unit called a container.</p> <p>You can run Percona XtraBackup in a Docker container without installing the product.

It copies your InnoDB data files, which results in data that is internally inconsistent; but then it performs crash recovery on the files to make them a consistent, usable database again.</p> <p>This works because InnoDB maintains a redo log, also called the transaction log. This contains a record of every change to InnoDB data. When InnoDB starts, it inspects the data files and the transaction log, and performs two steps. It applies committed transaction log entries to the data files, and it performs an undo operation on any transactions that modified data but did not commit.</p> <p>The <code>--register-redo-log-consumer</code> parameter is disabled by default. When enabled, this parameter lets Percona XtraBackup register as a redo log consumer at the start of the backup. The server does not remove a redo log that Percona XtraBackup (the consumer) has not yet copied. The consumer reads the redo log and manually advances the log sequence number (LSN). The server blocks the writes during the process. Based on the redo log consumption, the server determines when it can purge the log.  </p> <p>Percona XtraBackup remembers the LSN when it starts, and then copies the data files. The operation takes time, and the files may change, then LSN reflects the state of the database at different points in time. Percona XtraBackup also runs a background process that watches the transaction log files, and copies any changes. Percona XtraBackup does this continually. The transaction logs are written in a round-robin fashion, and can be reused.</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup uses Backup locks</p> <p>where available as a lightweight alternative to <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code>. MySQL 8.2 allows acquiring an instance level backup lock via the <code>LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</code> statement.</p> <p>Locking is only done for MyISAM and other non-InnoDB tables after Percona XtraBackup finishes backing up all InnoDB/XtraDB data and logs. Percona XtraBackup uses this automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>The <code>BACKUP_ADMIN</code> privilege is required to query the  <code>performance_schema_log_status</code> for either <code>LOCK  INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</code> or <code>LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP</code>.</p> <p>xtrabackup tries to avoid backup locks and <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> when the instance contains only InnoDB tables. In this case, xtrabackup obtains binary log coordinates from <code>performance_schema.log_status</code>. <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> is still required in MySQL 8.2 when xtrabackup is started with the <code>--slave-info</code>. The <code>log_status</code> table in Percona Server for MySQL 8.2 is extended to include the relay log coordinates, so no locks are needed even with the <code>--slave-info</code> option.</p> <p>See also</p> <p>MySQL Documentation: LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</p> <p>When backup locks are supported by the server, xtrabackup first copies InnoDB data, runs the <code>LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP</code> and then copies the MyISAM tables. Once this is done, the backup of the files will begin. It will backup .frm, .MRG, .MYD, .MYI, .CSM, .CSV, <code>.sdi</code> and <code>.par</code> files.</p> <p>After that xtrabackup will use <code>LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP</code> to block all operations that might change either binary log position or <code>Exec_Master_Log_Pos</code> or <code>Exec_Gtid_Set</code> (i.e. source binary log coordinates corresponding to the current SQL thread state on a replication replica) as reported by <code>SHOW MASTER/SLAVE STATUS</code>. xtrabackup will then finish copying the REDO log files and fetch the binary log coordinates. After this is completed xtrabackup will unlock the binary log and tables.</p> <p>Finally, the binary log position will be printed to <code>STDERR</code> and xtrabackup will exit returning 0 if all went OK.</p> <p>Note that the <code>STDERR</code> of xtrabackup is not written in any file. You will have to redirect it to a file, for example, <code>xtrabackup OPTIONS 2&gt; backupout.log</code>.</p> <p>It will also create the following files in the directory of the backup.</p> <p>During the <code>prepare</code> phase, Percona XtraBackup performs crash recovery against the copied data files, using the copied transaction log file. After this is done, the database is ready to restore and use.</p> <p>The backed-up MyISAM and InnoDB tables will be eventually consistent with each other, because after the prepare (recovery) process, InnoDB\u2019s data is rolled forward to the point at which the backup completed, not rolled back to the point at which it started. This point in time matches where the <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> was taken, so the MyISAM data and the prepared InnoDB data are in sync.</p> <p>The xtrabackup offers many features not mentioned in the preceding explanation. The functionality of each tool is explained in more detail further in this manual. In brief, though, the tools enable you to do operations such as streaming and incremental backups with various combinations of copying the data files, copying the log files, and applying the logs to the data.</p>"},{"location":"how-xtrabackup-works.html#restoring-a-backup","title":"Restoring a backup","text":"<p>To restore a backup with xtrabackup you can use the <code>--copy-back</code> or <code>--move-back</code> options.</p> <p>xtrabackup will read from the <code>my.cnf</code> the variables datadir, innodb_data_home_dir, innodb_data_file_path, innodb_log_group_home_dir and check that the directories exist.</p> <p>It will copy the MyISAM tables, indexes, etc. (.MRG, .MYD, .MYI, .CSM, .CSV, <code>.sdi</code>, and <code>par</code> files) first, InnoDB tables and indexes next and the log files at last.

These modifications are only for the xtrabackup binary; you do not need a modified InnoDB to use xtrabackup for your backups.</p> <p>The prepare step uses this \u201cembedded InnoDB\u201d to perform crash recovery on the copied data files, using the copied log file. The <code>prepare</code> step is very simple to use: you simply run xtrabackup with the <code>--prepare</code> option and tell it which directory to prepare, for example, to prepare the previously taken backup run:</p> <pre><code>$ xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/backups/\n</code></pre> <p>When this finishes, you should see an <code>InnoDB shutdown</code> with a message such as the following, where again the value of LSN will depend on your system:</p> Expected output <pre><code>InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 137345046\n160906 11:21:01 completed OK!\n</code></pre> <p>All following prepares will not change the already prepared data files, you\u2019ll see that output says:</p> Expected output <pre><code>xtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared.\nxtrabackup: notice: xtrabackup_logfile was already used to '--prepare'.\n</code></pre> <p>It is not recommended to interrupt xtrabackup process while preparing backup because it may cause data files corruption and backup will become unusable.

In full backups, two types of operations are performed to make the database consistent: committed transactions are replayed from the log file against the data files, and uncommitted transactions are rolled back. You must skip the rollback of uncommitted transactions when preparing an incremental backup, because transactions that were uncommitted at the time of your backup may be in progress, and it\u2019s likely that they will be committed in the next incremental backup. You should use the <code>--apply-log-only</code> option to prevent the rollback phase.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you do not use the <code>--apply-log-only</code> option to prevent the rollback phase, then your incremental backups will be useless. After transactions have been rolled back, further incremental backups cannot be applied.</p> <p>Beginning with the full backup you created, you can prepare it, and then apply the incremental differences to it. Recall that you have the following backups:</p> <pre><code>/data/backups/base\n/data/backups/inc1\n/data/backups/inc2\n</code></pre> <p>To prepare the base backup, you need to run <code>--prepare</code> as usual, but prevent the rollback phase:</p> <pre><code>$ xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backups/base\n</code></pre> <p>The output should end with text similar to the following:</p> Expected output <pre><code>InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 1626007\n161011 12:41:04 completed OK!\n</code></pre> <p>The log sequence number should match the <code>to_lsn</code> of the base backup, which you saw previously.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This backup is actually safe to restore as-is now, even though the rollback phase has been skipped. If you restore it and start MySQL, InnoDB will detect that the rollback phase was not performed, and it will do that in the background, as it usually does for a crash recovery upon start. It will notify you that the database was not shut down normally.</p> <p>To apply the first incremental backup to the full backup, run the following command:</p> <pre><code>$ xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backups/base \\\n--incremental-dir=/data/backups/inc1\n</code></pre> <p>This applies the delta files to the files in <code>/data/backups/base</code>, which rolls them forward in time to the time of the incremental backup. It then applies the redo log as usual to the result. The final data is in <code>/data/backups/base</code>, not in the incremental directory. You should see an output similar to:</p> Expected output <pre><code>incremental backup from 1626007 is enabled.\nxtrabackup: cd to /data/backups/base\nxtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared with --apply-log-only.\nxtrabackup: xtrabackup_logfile detected: size=2097152, start_lsn=(4124244)\n...\nxtrabackup: page size for /tmp/backups/inc1/ibdata1.delta is 16384 bytes\nApplying /tmp/backups/inc1/ibdata1.delta to ./ibdata1...\n...\n161011 12:45:56 completed OK!\n</code></pre> <p>Again, the LSN should match what you saw from your earlier inspection of the first incremental backup.

For example, a chunk upload or download may fail if you have an unstable network connection or other network issues. This feature adds an exponential backoff, or sleep, time and then retries the upload or download.</p> <p>When a chunk upload or download operation fails, xbcloud checks the reason for the failure. This failure can be a CURL error or an HTTP error, or a client-specific error. If the error is listed in the Retriable errors list, xbcloud pauses for a calculated time before retrying the operation until that time reaches the <code>--max-backoff</code> value.</p> <p>The operation is retried until the <code>--max-retries</code> value is reached. If the chunk operation fails on the last retry, xbcloud aborts the process.</p> <p>The default values are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\u2013max-backoff = 300000 (5 minutes)</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2013max-retries = 10</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can adjust the number of retries by adding the <code>--max-retries</code> parameter and adjust the maximum length of time between retries by adding the <code>--max-backoff</code> parameter to an xbcloud command.</p> <p>Since xbcloud does multiple asynchronous requests in parallel, a calculated value, measured in milliseconds, is used for <code>max-backoff</code>. This algorithm calculates how many milliseconds to sleep before the next retry. A number generated is based on the combining the power of two (2), the number of retries already attempted and adds a random number between 1 and 1000. This number avoids network congestion if multiple chunks have the same backoff value. If the default values are used, the final retry attempt to be approximately 17 minutes after the first try. The number is no longer calculated when the milliseconds reach the <code>--max-backoff</code> setting. At that point, the retries continue by using the <code>--max-backoff</code> setting until the <code>max-retries</code> parameter is reached.</p>"},{"location":"xbcloud-exbackoff.html#retriable-errors","title":"Retriable errors","text":"<p>We retry for the following CURL operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CURLE_GOT_NOTHING</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEOUT</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_RECV_ERROR</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_SEND_ERROR</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_SEND_FAIL_REWIND</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE</p> </li> <li> <p>CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR</p> </li> </ul> <p>We retry for the following HTTP operation status codes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>503</p> </li> <li> <p>500</p> </li> <li> <p>504</p> </li> <li> <p>408</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each cloud provider may return a different CURL error or an HTTP error, depending on the issue.

The InnoDB's configuration in this context means server variables that affect dataformat, i.e., <code>innodb_page_size</code> option, <code>innodb_log_block_size</code>, etc. Location-related variables, like <code>innodb_log_group_home_dir</code> or <code>innodb_data_file_path</code> are always ignored by <code>--prepare</code>, so preparing a backup always works with data files from the back directory, rather than any external ones.     <code>xtrabackup_checkpoints</code><p>The type of the backup (for example, full or incremental),  its state (for example, prepared) and the LSN range contained in it.
