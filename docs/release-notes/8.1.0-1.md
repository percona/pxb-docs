# Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 (2023-11-02)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona XtraBackup](..//quickstart-overview.md).

[Percona XtraBackup (PXB)](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) is a 100% open source backup solution for all versions of Percona Server for MySQL and MySQLÂ® that performs online non-blocking, tightly compressed, highly secure full backups on transactional systems. Maintain fully available applications during planned maintenance windows with Percona XtraBackup.

This is an Innovation release. This type of release is only supported for a short time and is designed to be used in an environment with fast upgrade cycles. Developers and DBAs are exposed to the latest features and improvements.

## Release highlights

Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 is based on MySQL 8.1 and fully supports the Percona Server for MySQL 8.1 Innovation series and the MySQL 8.1 Innovation series. This release allows taking backups of Percona Server 8.1.0-1 and MySQL 8.1.

Use the Percona XtraBackup 8.0 series to take backups of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x or MySQL 8.0.x. Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 does not take a backup of the Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 or the MySQL 8.0.x series.

## Improvement

* [PXB-3155] : The Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 series implemented the keyring_vault plugin. In the Innovation series, the server shifts to a component infrastructure, the keyring's functionality remains the same. Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 supports the component keyring_vault. Users are able to back up their encrypted data after they convert from the keyring_vault plugin to the keyring_vault component.

## Deprecated or removed

The `--stats` mode of operation for the xtrabackup binary has been removed.

Only the keyring_vault component, the [KMIP component], and the AWS KMS component versions are supported.

For the `keyring_file` both the plugin and component are supported. The `keyring_file` plugin is deprecated and may be removed in the future.
