Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona XtraBackup](..//..//quickstart-overview.md).

[Percona XtraBackup (PXB)](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) is a 100% open source backup solution for all versions of Percona Server for MySQL and MySQLÂ® that performs online non-blocking, tightly compressed, highly secure full backups on transactional systems. Maintain fully available applications during planned maintenance windows with Percona XtraBackup.

Check the latest list of all [Supported versions](..//..//supported-versions.md).

### Compression

The [ZSTD compression algorithm](..//..//create-compressed-backup.md) is moved to [General Availability](..//..//glossary.md#general-availability-ga) and becomes the default compression algorithm for the [`--compress`](..//..//create-compressed-backup.md) option.

The `QuickLZ` compression algorithm is removed and is not used for `--backup`. The `--decompress` option still uses `qpress` for backward compatibility to decompress backups taken by older versions of Percona XtraBackup.

## New features

* [PXB-3059](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3059): Adds the `--redo-log-arch-dir=name` option to  
set the redo log archive destination directory. (Thanks to wangbincmss for providing the patch)

## Improvements

* [PXB-3007](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3007): The [ZSTD compression algorithm](..//..//create-compressed-backup.md) is moved to [General Availability](..//..//glossary.md#general-availability-ga) and becomes the default compression algorithm for the [`--compress`](..//..//create-compressed-backup.md) option.

## Bug fix

* [PXB-3073](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3073): An unresponsive host may cause `xbcloud` to become stuck. Added a `--timeout` option to `xbcloud`.

* [PXB-3088](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3088): Percona XtraBackup could not prepare the backup if the redo log size was more than 128G. (Thanks to Ahmed Et-tanany for providing the fix for this issue)

* [PXB-3079](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3079): The prepare phase skipped rollback on encrypted tables and was completed successfully if the keyring plugin was not loaded.

* [PXB-2860](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2860): Percona XtraBackup locked table even when the  `--tables-exclude` and `--lock-ddl-per-table` options were used.
