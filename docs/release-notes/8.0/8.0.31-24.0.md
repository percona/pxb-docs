## Release highlights

This release adds the ability to use an IAM instance profile when running xbcloud from an EC2 instance. An IAM instance profile does not need the `--s3-secret-key` nor the `--s3-access-key` but the profile has a six-hour lifespan.

With this version, `qpress`/`QuickLZ` are deprecated. 

## New features

[PXB-2856](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2856): Use [IAM instance profile when running xbcloud from an EC2 instance](../../xbcloud/xbcloud-iam-profile.md).

[PXB-2869](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2869): A warning is printed on backup that qpress/QuickLZ is deprecated.

## Bug fixes

[PXB-2890](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2890): XtraBackup did not compress already compressed tables.

[PXB-2928](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2928): XtraBackup exits with signal 11 when taking a backup using page tracking.

[PXB-2854](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2854): Fixed a memory corruption issue in QuickLZ.

[PXB-2925](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2925): The PXB start_lsn, during the prepare phase, did not match the redo file start LSN when a wait was added in the backup phase after calling `recv_find_max_checkpoint` and before copying the checkpoint header.

[PXB-2964](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2964): XtraBackup required a very high open files limit.

[PXB-2959](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2959): XtraBackup now compiles on platforms with OpenSSL 3.0.

[PXB-2971](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2971): XtraBackup copied local manifest files which caused node failures when the files overrode settings on another node.

## Deprecation and removal

Starting with Percona XtraBackup 8.0.31-24, using qpress/QuickLZ to compress backups is deprecated and may be removed in future versions. We recommend using either the `LZ4` or the Zstandard (`ZSTD`) compression algorithms.
