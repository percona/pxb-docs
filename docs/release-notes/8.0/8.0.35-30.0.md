## Release highlights

This release merges the MySQL 8.0.35 code base.

## Bug fix

* [PXB-3003](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3003): Percona XtraBackup discovering redo logs to parse and the server purging redo logs simultaneously could cause a race condition.

* [PXB-3139](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3139): Fix for gcc-13 and clang-16 compilation issues.

* [PXB-3147](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3147): Percona XtraBackup failed to execute the `DO innodb_redo_log_consumer_register("PXB");` query.

* [PXB-3181](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3181): The use of the `innodb-use-native-aio=true` option resulted in printing duplicate timestamps.

* [PXB-3173](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3173): The xbcloud was refactored to use multiple threads with a global list of files. This list did not allow users to download a subset of files.

* [PXB-3141](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3141): Adjusted folder creation on `ds_fifo.cc` and xbcloud to use proper permission.

* [PXB-3168](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-3168): Under high write load, a backup could fail with a `log block numbers mismatch` error.
