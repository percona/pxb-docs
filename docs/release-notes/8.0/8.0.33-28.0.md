# Percona XtraBackup 8.0.33-28 (2023-07-19)

[Percona XtraBackup (PXB)](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) is a 100% open source backup solution for all versions of Percona Server for MySQL and MySQLÂ® that performs online non-blocking, tightly compressed, highly secure full backups on transactional systems. Maintain fully available applications during planned maintenance windows with Percona XtraBackup.

## Release highlights

This release includes improvements, features, and bug fixes. Percona has implemented a two-stage release process for each version. The first release primarily ensures compatibility with the latest MySQL version, to help those customers who need an updated version of Percona XtraBackup as soon as possible. The second release contains additional bug fixes and any improvements or new features.

Percona XtraBackup 8.0.33-28 implements a new data sink that uses the first in, first out (FIF0) method. With the [FIFO data sink](..//..//xbcloud-binary-fifo-datasink.md) feature, users with a streaming capacity of 10Gbps (typically on a Local Area Network (LAN)) can benefit from faster backups by streaming data in parallel to object storage. This feature is in [tech preview](..//..//glossary.md#tech-preview).

Percona XtraBackup 8.0.33-28 implements the [Dictionary cache](..//..//dictionary-cache.md) feature. Dictionary cache improves the performance of xtrabackup `--prepare` operation.
