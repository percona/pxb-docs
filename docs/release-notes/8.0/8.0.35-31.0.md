Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona XtraBackup](..//..//quickstart-overview.md).

## Supported versions

Check the latest list of all [Supported versions](..//..//supported-versions.md).

## Release highlights

This release adds Percona XtraBackup ARM64 packages and provides bug fixes.

We recommend that you download the Percona XtraBackup for the same platform as the MySQL-compatible server. For example, if your server is on an ARM64 platform, you should download and use the Percona XtraBackup for ARM64 for that operating system.

## Bug fix

* [PXB-3283]: If backup contains tables with [temporal datatypes] (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-types.html) and their charset/collation changed (ALTER TABLE CONVERT CHARACTER SET) before the backup is taken, xtrabackup export couldn't generate the correct configuration (.cfg) files required by the import.

* [PXB-2797]: When you import a table with a full-text index from an XtraBackup backup, you might encounter a schema mismatch. This happens when the table's structure in the backup does not match the structure expected by the database.

* [PXB-3210]: Percona XtraBackup version 8.0.33-28 and later fail to build on MacOS because of the FIND_PROCPS() function. This function causes issues during the build process, preventing the software from compiling successfully.

* [PXB-3130]: When preparing 8.0.30 backups with newer xtrabackup versions, the prepare step failed. (Thank you to LiNing for the contribution!)
