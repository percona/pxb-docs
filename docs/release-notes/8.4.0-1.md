## Improvements

### Implemented in Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1

* [PXB-3153](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXB-3153): Extends the `--export` option during the `--prepare` phase to generate a `.sql` file, which provides the schema for each `.ibd` tablespace file.

* [PXB-3034](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXB-3034): Reduces the time the instance remains locked during the backup.

### Implemented in Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 (Innovation release) and supported in Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1

* [PXB-3155](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXB-3155): The Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 series implemented the `keyring_vault` plugin. In the Innovation series and 8.4 version, the server shifts to a component infrastructure, the keyringâ€™s functionality remains the same. Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1 supports the component `keyring_vault`. Users can back up their encrypted data after they convert from the `keyring_vault` plugin to the `keyring_vault` component.

## Deprecated or removed

### Changes made in Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1

* Removed offensive terminology (Master/Slave) to align with MySQL 8.4.0.

## Changes inherited from Percona XtraBackup 8.1.0-1 (Innovation release)

* The `--stats` mode of operation for the xtrabackup binary has been removed.

* Only the `keyring_vault component`, the [`KMIP component`](..//using-kmip.md), and the `AWS KMS component` versions are supported. For the `keyring_file` both the plugin and component are supported. The `keyring_file` plugin is deprecated and may be removed in the future.
