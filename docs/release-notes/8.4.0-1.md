#  Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1 (2024-08-20)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona XtraBackup].

## Release highlights

Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1 is based on MySQL 8.4 Long Term Supported (LTS) Release. This release allows taking backups of Percona Server for MySQL and MySQL 8.4.0, 8.4.1, 8.4.2 and future 8.4 LTS releases.

Use the [Percona XtraBackup 8.0 series] to take backups of [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x] and MySQL 8.0.x series.

Use the Percona XtraBackup Innovation series, the latest version is [8.3.0-1], to take backups of Percona Server for MySQL Innovation series and MySQL Innovation series.

## Improvements

### Implementations inherited from the Innovation releases

* [PXB-3155](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXB-3155): The Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 series implemented the [keyring_vault] plugin. In the Innovation series and 8.4 version, the server shifts to a component infrastructure, the keyringâ€™s functionality remains the same. Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1 supports the `keyring_vault` component. Users can back up their encrypted data after they convert from the `keyring_vault` plugin to the `keyring_vault` component.

## Bug fixes

* [PXB-3302](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXB-3302): When a MySQL instance had an exceptionally large number of Global Transaction Identifier (GTID) sets, the `GTID of the last change` in the Xtrabackup log output got truncated. This truncation did not occur in the full output found in the `xtrabackup_binlog_info` and `xtrabackup_info` files.

## Deprecated or removed

* The terms MASTER and SLAVE have been replaced with SOURCE and REPLICA to align with MySQL 8.4.0. Find the full list of removed (MASTER/SLAVE) terminology in the [MySQL Deprecation and Removal Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.4/en/news-8-4-0.html).

* Percona XtraBackup 8.4.0-1 removes support for the [Keyring file plugin]. Use the [Keyring file component] instead.

* The `--stats` mode of operation for the xtrabackup binary has been removed.
