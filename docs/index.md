## Supported storage engines

Percona XtraBackup can back up data from InnoDB, XtraDB,
MyISAM, MyRocks tables on MySQL {{vers}} servers and Percona Server for MySQL with XtraDB, Percona Server for MySQL {{vers}}, and Percona XtraDB Cluster {{vers}}.

Percona XtraBackup {{vers}} supports the MyRocks storage engine. An incremental backup on the MyRocks storage engine does not determine if an earlier full or incremental backup contains duplicate files. Percona XtraBackup copies all MyRocks files each time it takes a backup.

### Limitations

Percona XtraBackup {{vers}} does not support making backups of databases
created in versions before {{vers}} of MySQL, Percona Server for MySQL or
Percona XtraDB Cluster.
