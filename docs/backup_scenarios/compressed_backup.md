# Compressed Backup

*Percona XtraBackup* supports compressed backups. A local or streaming
backup
can be compressed or decompressed with *xbstream*.

## Creating Compressed Backups

In order to make a compressed backup you’ll need to use the `--compress`
option:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --backup --compress --target-dir=/data/compressed/
```

The `--compress` uses the `qpress` tool that you can install via
the `percona-release` package configuration tool as follows:

```shell
$ sudo percona-release enable tools
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install qpress
```

!!! note
   
    Enable the repository: `percona-release enable-only tools release`.

If *Percona XtraBackup* is intended to be used in combination with
the upstream MySQL Server, you only need to enable the `tools`
repository: `percona-release enable-only tools`.

If you want to speed up the compression you can use the parallel
compression,
which can be enabled with `--compress-threads` option.
Following example will use four threads for compression:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --backup --compress --compress-threads=4 \
--target-dir=/data/compressed/
```

Output should look like this

```
...text
170223 13:00:38 [01] Compressing ./test/sbtest1.frm to /tmp/compressed/test/sbtest1.frm.qp
170223 13:00:38 [01]        ...done
170223 13:00:38 [01] Compressing ./test/sbtest2.frm to /tmp/compressed/test/sbtest2.frm.qp
170223 13:00:38 [01]        ...done
...
170223 13:00:39 [00] Compressing xtrabackup_info
170223 13:00:39 [00]        ...done
xtrabackup: Transaction log of lsn (9291934) to (9291934) was copied.
170223 13:00:39 completed OK!
```

### Preparing the backup

Before you can prepare the backup you’ll need to uncompress all the files.
*Percona XtraBackup* has implemented `--decompress` option
that can be used to decompress the backup.

```shell
$ xtrabackup --decompress --target-dir=/data/compressed/
```

!!! note
   
    `--parallel` can be used with `--decompress` option to decompress multiple files simultaneously. 

*Percona XtraBackup* does not automatically remove the compressed files. In
order to clean up the backup directory you should use
`--remove-original` option. Even if they’re not removed
these files will not be copied/moved over to the datadir if
`--copy-back` or `--move-back` are used.

When the files are uncompressed you can prepare the backup with the
`--prepare` option:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/compressed/
```

You should check for a confirmation message:

```text
InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 9293846
170223 13:39:31 completed OK!
```

Now the files in `/data/compressed/` are ready to be used by the server.

### Restoring the backup

*xtrabackup* has a `--copy-back` option, which performs the
restoration of a backup to the server’s datadir:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=/data/backups/
```

It will copy all the data-related files back to the server’s datadir,
determined by the server’s `my.cnf` configuration file. You should check
the last line of the output for a success message:

```text
170223 13:49:13 completed OK!
```

You should check the file permissions after copying the data back. You may
need
to adjust them with something like:

```shell
$ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
```

Now that the datadir contains the restored data. You are ready to start
the server.
