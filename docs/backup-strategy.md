# Backup strategy and backup policy

In conversation, 'backup strategy,' 'backup policy,' and 'backup plan' are used interchangeably, but the terms have distinct meanings.

A backup strategy is an overall approach or methodology for backing up the data in a database system. The strategy includes the decisions and considerations for what data to back up, how frequently backups should be taken, what backup methods and technologies to use, where to store the backup files, and what steps should be taken to ensure data integrity and the ability to recover.

A backup strategy typically involves business requirements, the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), the maximum acceptable data loss in case of system failure or disaster, and the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), the acceptable downtime for restoring the system after a failure, and compliance regulations.

A backup policy defines the guidelines, rules, or standards for specific procedures and practices for implementing the backup strategy.

The policy outlines the following:

* Detailed steps and parameters for performing backups

* Retention periods

* Backup types

* Backup verification methods

* Error handling procedures

* Security measures

A backup plan, based on the backup strategy and the backup policy, is a detailed operation document that specifies how to execute the backup strategy in actionable steps and defines the timelines for backup activities. 

A backup plan can include the following details:

* Who performs the backup

* When backups are scheduled

* How backups are monitored and audited

* What actions to take in case of backup failures or emergencies


## Types of backup

A [full backup] copies all data to a storage location. This type of backup creates a complete copy of the data set. The benefit of a full backup is a quick recovery since the data is stored in one place. However, this type of backup is also the most time-consuming and storage-intensive; it duplicates all data regardless of whether it has changed since the last backup.

An [incremental backup] only copies data that has changed since the last backup, whether that was a full or another incremental backup. This method is faster and more storage-efficient than a full backup. However, the recovery can be slower because you must restore each set of changes in sequence.

For more information, see the [example of using a full backup with incremental backups].

## Backup policy defined

The backup policy sets the guidelines and objectives for data protection, while the backup strategy provides the roadmap for achieving those objectives.

A backup policy may state that all customer data must be backed up daily, with a full backup at the start of each week and incremental backups taken each business day. These definitions are based on the following: It also defines how long backups should be retained based on legal or regulatory requirements.

The difference between a backup policy and a backup strategy lies in their scope and detail. A backup policy is more about the following:

* 'what' — What should be backed up and may include information on compliance and governance

* 'when' - When should you do backups

The backup strategy contains the 'how' — how the backups are scheduled and includes information on the backup technologies and the restoration process.  

The backup strategy details the use of specific backup software, the configuration of backup schedules, the process for monitoring backup success, and the necessary steps for restoring data.

## Backup policy best practices

An effective backup policy is crucial for safeguarding an organization's data integrity and availability. Here are some best practices to consider:

## Test the backups

You must test the effectiveness of your backups and demonstrate that you can recover your data in the event of loss or corruption. 

Here are several methods to assess the reliability of your backup system:

| Aspect                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perform Regular Test Restores      | The most reliable way to test backups is to periodically restore the data to a separate system. This restoration verifies the backup's integrity and the restoration process's functionality.                                                                                                                             |
| Monitor Backup Reports             | Regularly review backup reports and logs for any errors or failures during the backup process. This can help identify issues early before they become critical problems.                                                                                                                                               |
| Check for Data Consistency         | Compare the original data with the backed-up data to ensure consistency. This can be done by checking file sizes, using checksums, or employing other data validation techniques. One tool would be to use [`pt-table-checksum`].                                                                                  |
| Simulate Disaster Scenarios        | Conducting a simulated disaster recovery exercise can help determine how well your backup system will perform under stress and identify any gaps in your recovery plan.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Audit Backup Procedures            | Regular audits of the backup procedures can ensure that the backups are being performed in accordance with the established policies and that the backup system is functioning as expected.                                                                                                                             |
| Validate Backup Configuration     | Ensure that the backup configuration is correct and that all necessary data is being backed up. This includes checking backup schedules, retention policies, and the scope of the data backed up.                                                                                                                        |
| Verify Security Measures           | Confirm that the backup data is secure and that encryption and other security measures are functioning correctly to protect against unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Evaluate Recovery Time Objectives  | Measure how long it takes to restore data from backups and compare this with your recovery time objectives to ensure they align with your business requirements.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Assess Backup Media Reliability    | Regularly check the physical and logical condition of the backup media, whether it's tape, disk, or cloud storage, to ensure it's in good working order.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Conduct Incremental Backup Tests  | Test the restoration of incremental backups to ensure that they work in conjunction with full backups and that the data can be restored to a specific point in time.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Review Backup Software Updates     | Keep the backup software updated and test after updates to ensure new versions or patches do not introduce issues with the backup or restoration processes.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Check for Compatibility Issues     | Ensure that the backup system is compatible with all the software and data formats used in your organization to avoid restoration issues.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Document Test Results              | Keep detailed records of all backup tests, including the scope, date, issues encountered, and resolutions. This documentation can be invaluable for troubleshooting and improving the backup process.                                                                                                                |


By implementing these methods, you are confident that your backup system protects your data and can recover your data when necessary. Regular testing and monitoring are key to maintaining an effective backup strategy and ensuring business continuity. Remember, the goal of testing is not just to prove that backups can be restored, but to identify and resolve any issues before an actual disaster occurs. This proactive approach can save valuable time and resources, and ultimately, safeguard your organization's data integrity.

### Common challenges

Common backup challenges often include issues such as damaged backups, missing or failed backups, maintaining legacy systems, adhering to strict privacy and security regulations, and managing the costs associated with data backup. To overcome these challenges, organizations can adopt several strategies. Implementing a modern, reliable backup solution that includes automated data consistency checking can help protect against damaged backups. Regular recovery tests can ensure that data is recoverable and not corrupt.

For missing or failed backups, it's essential to have a robust monitoring system that alerts IT staff to any issues with the backup process. This allows for immediate action to rectify any problems before they escalate. Maintaining legacy systems can be addressed by gradually phasing out older technology and replacing it with more current, supported solutions. This can help avoid the pitfalls of outdated systems that may not be compatible with newer technologies or that may no longer be supported by the vendor.

Adhering to privacy and security regulations requires a thorough understanding of the laws and standards that apply to an organization's industry and geography. Implementing encryption and access controls can help ensure that backups are secure and compliant with regulations. Finally, managing the costs of data backup involves careful planning and budgeting. Organizations should consider the total cost of ownership of their backup solutions, including initial investment, ongoing maintenance, and potential costs associated with data recovery.

In addition to these strategies, it's essential to follow best practices such as the 3-2-1 backup rule, which suggests having three copies of data on two different media, with one copy stored offsite. Regular testing and validation of backups, clear documentation of backup procedures, and continuous training for staff involved in the backup process are also crucial for overcoming common backup challenges. By staying vigilant and proactive, organizations can ensure that their data remains secure and recoverable, even in these challenges.


## Disaster recovery plan

A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a structured approach with detailed instructions for responding to unplanned incidents such as natural disasters, power outages, cyber-attacks, and other disruptive events.

This table organizes the different sections of the disaster recovery plan, along with brief descriptions of each section.
