# How Percona XtraBackup works

Percona XtraBackup is based on InnoDB’s crash-recovery functionality.
It copies your InnoDB data files, which results in data that is internally
inconsistent; but then it performs crash recovery on the files to make them a
consistent, usable database again.

This works because InnoDB maintains a redo log, also called the transaction
log. This contains a record of every change to InnoDB data. When InnoDB
starts, it inspects the data files and the transaction log, and performs two
steps. It applies committed transaction log entries to the data files, and it
performs an undo operation on any transactions that modified data but did not
commit.

The `--register-redo-log-consumer` parameter is disabled by default. When enabled, this parameter lets Percona XtraBackup register as a redo log consumer at the start of the backup. The server does not remove a redo log that Percona XtraBackup (the consumer) has not yet copied. The consumer reads the redo log and manually advances the log sequence number (LSN). The server blocks the writes during the process. Based on the redo log consumption, the server determines when it can purge the log.  

Percona XtraBackup remembers the LSN when it starts, and then copies the data files. The operation takes time, and the files may change, then LSN reflects the state of the database
at different points in time. Percona XtraBackup also runs a
background process that watches the transaction log files, and copies any changes. Percona XtraBackup does this continually. The transaction logs are written in a round-robin fashion, and can be reused.

Percona XtraBackup uses [Backup locks](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/backup-locks.html)

where available as a lightweight alternative to `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
LOCK`. MySQL {{release}} allows
acquiring an instance level backup lock via the `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP`
statement.

Locking is only done for MyISAM and other non-InnoDB tables
after Percona XtraBackup finishes backing up all InnoDB/XtraDB data and
logs. Percona XtraBackup uses this automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to
avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.

    The `BACKUP_ADMIN` privilege is required to query the 
    `performance_schema_log_status` for either `LOCK 
    INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` or `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`.

xtrabackup tries to avoid backup locks and `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`
when the instance contains only InnoDB tables. In this case, xtrabackup
obtains binary log coordinates from `performance_schema.log_status`. `FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK` is still required in MySQL {{release}} when xtrabackup is
started with the `--slave-info`. The `log_status` table in Percona
Server for MySQL {{release}} is extended to include the relay log coordinates, so no locks are
needed even with the `--slave-info` option.

When backup locks are supported by the server, xtrabackup first copies
InnoDB data, runs the `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP` and then copies the MyISAM
tables. Once this is done, the backup of the files will
begin. It will backup .frm, .MRG, .MYD, .MYI, .CSM,
.CSV, `.sdi` and `.par` files.

After that xtrabackup will use `LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP` to block all
operations that might change either binary log position or
`Exec_Master_Log_Pos` or `Exec_Gtid_Set` (i.e. source binary log coordinates
corresponding to the current SQL thread state on a replication replica) as
reported by `SHOW MASTER/SLAVE STATUS`. xtrabackup will then finish copying
the REDO log files and fetch the binary log coordinates. After this is completed
xtrabackup will unlock the binary log and tables.

Finally, the binary log position will be printed to `STDERR` and xtrabackup
will exit returning 0 if all went OK.

Note that the `STDERR` of xtrabackup is not written in any file. You will
have to redirect it to a file, for example, `xtrabackup OPTIONS 2> backupout.log`.

It will also create the following files in the
directory of the backup.

During the `prepare` phase, Percona XtraBackup performs crash recovery against
the copied data files, using the copied transaction log file. After this is
done, the database is ready to restore and use.

The backed-up MyISAM and InnoDB tables will be eventually consistent with
each other, because after the prepare (recovery) process, InnoDB’s data is
rolled forward to the point at which the backup completed, not rolled back to
the point at which it started. This point in time matches where the `FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK` was taken, so the MyISAM data and the prepared
InnoDB data are in sync.

The xtrabackup offers many features not mentioned in the preceding
explanation. The functionality of each tool is explained in more
detail further in this manual. In brief, though, the tools enable you
to do operations such as streaming and incremental backups with
various combinations of copying the data files, copying the log files,
and applying the logs to the data.

## Restoring a backup

To restore a backup with xtrabackup you can use the `--copy-back` or
`--move-back` options.

xtrabackup will read from the `my.cnf` the variables datadir,
innodb_data_home_dir, innodb_data_file_path,
innodb_log_group_home_dir and check that the directories exist.

It will copy the MyISAM tables, indexes, etc. (.MRG, .MYD,
.MYI, .CSM, .CSV, `.sdi`,
and `par` files) first, InnoDB tables and indexes next and the log files at
last. It will preserve file’s attributes when copying them, you may have to
change the files’ ownership to `mysql` before starting the database server, as
they will be owned by the user who created the backup.

Alternatively, the `--move-back` option may be used to
restore a backup. This option is similar to `--copy-back`
with the only difference that instead of copying files it moves them to their
target locations. As this option removes backup files, it must be used with
caution. It is useful in cases when there is not enough free disk space to hold
both data files and their backup copies.
