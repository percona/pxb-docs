# Create a full backup

To create a backup, run xtrabackup with the `--backup`
option. You also must specify the `--target-dir` option, which is where
the backup is stored. If the InnoDB data or log files are not stored
in
the same directory, you must specify their location.
If the
target directory does not exist, xtrabackup creates it. If the directory
does
exist and is empty, xtrabackup succeeds.

xtrabackup does not overwrite existing files. it will fail with operating
system error 17, `file exists`.

The following command starts the process:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backups/
```

This operation stores the backup at `/data/backups/`. If you specify a
relative path, the target directory is relative to the current directory.

During the backup process, the output shows the copied data
files, and a log file thread that scans and copies from the
log files.

The following is an example of the output:

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    160906 10:19:17 Finished backing up non-InnoDB tables and files
    160906 10:19:17 Executing FLUSH NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG ENGINE LOGS...

    160906 10:19:18 All tables unlocked
    160906 10:19:18 Backup created in directory '/data/backups/'

    160906 10:19:18 [00]        ...done
    160906 10:19:18 [00] Writing xtrabackup_info
    160906 10:19:18 [00]        ...done
    xtrabackup: Transaction log of lsn (26970807) to (137343534) was copied.
    160906 10:19:18 completed OK!
    ```

The process ends with the following statement; the
value of the `<LSN>` depends on your system:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ xtrabackup: Transaction log of lsn (<LSN>) to (<LSN>) was copied.
```

!!! note
   
    Log copying thread checks the transactional log every second to see if there were any new log records written that need to be copied, but there is a chance that the log copying thread might not be able to keep up with the amount of writes that go to the transactional logs, and will hit an error when the log records are overwritten before they could be read.

After the backup is finished, the target directory will contain files such as the following, assuming you have a single InnoDB table `test.tbl1` and you are using MySQLâ€™s innodb_file_per_table option:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ ls -lh /data/backups/
```

The result should look like this:

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    total 182M
    drwx------  7 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 .
    drwxrwxrwt 11 root root 4.0K Sep  6 11:05 ..
    -rw-r-----  1 root root  387 Sep  6 10:19 backup-my.cnf
    -rw-r-----  1 root root  76M Sep  6 10:19 ibdata1
    drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 mysql
    drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 performance_schema
    drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 sbtest
    drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 test
    drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Sep  6 10:19 world2
    -rw-r-----  1 root root  116 Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_checkpoints
    -rw-r-----  1 root root  433 Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_info
    -rw-r-----  1 root root 106M Sep  6 10:19 xtrabackup_logfile
    ```

The backup can take a long time, depending on how large the database is. It is safe to cancel at any time, because xtrabackup does not modify the database.
