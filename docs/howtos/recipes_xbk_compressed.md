# Making a Compressed Backup

In order to make a compressed backup, use the `--compress` option along
with the `--backup` and `--target-dir` options. By default
`--compress` uses the `quicklz` compression algorithm.

```shell
$ xtrabackup --backup --compress --target-dir=/data/backup
```

You can also use the `lz4` compression algorithm by setting :
option:`--compress` to `lz4`.

```shell
$ xtrabackup --backup --compress=lz4 --target-dir=/data/backup
```

If you want to speed up the compression you can use the parallel
compression, which can be enabled with `--compress-threads`
option. The following example uses four threads for compression.

```shell
$ xtrabackup --backup --compress --compress-threads=4 --target-dir=/data/backup
```

Output should look like this

```text
...

[01] Compressing ./imdb/comp_cast_type.ibd to /data/backup/imdb/comp_cast_type.ibd.qp
[01]        ...done
...
130801 11:50:24  xtrabackup: completed OK
```

## Preparing the backup

Before you can prepare the backup youâ€™ll need to uncompress all the files
with
[qpress](http://www.quicklz.com/) (which is available
from [Percona Software
repositories](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/8.0/installation.html#using-percona-software-repositories))
.
You can use the following one-liner to uncompress all the files:

```shell
$ for bf in `find . -iname "*\.qp"`; do qpress -d $bf $(dirname $bf) && rm $bf; done
```

If you used the `lz4` compression algorithm change this script to search
for `\*.lz4` files:

```shell
$ for bf in `find . -iname "*\.lz4"`; do lz4 -d $bf $(dirname $bf) && rm $bf; done
```

You can decompress the backup by using the `--decompress` option:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --decompress --target-dir=/data/backup/
```

When the files are uncompressed you can prepare the backup with the
`--apply-log-only` option:

```shell
$ xtrabackup --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backup/
```

You should check for a confirmation message:

```text
130802 02:51:02  xtrabackup: completed OK!
```

Now the files in `/data/backup/` is ready to be used by the server.

!!! note
   
    *Percona XtraBackup* does not automatically remove the compressed files. In order to clean up the backup directory users should remove the `\*.qp` files.

## Restoring the backup

Once the backup has been prepared you can use the `--copy-back` to
restore the backup.

```shell
$ xtrabackup --copy-back --target-dir=/data/backup/
```

This will copy the prepared data back to its original location as defined
by the
`datadir` variable in the `my.cnf` file.

After the confirmation message, you should check the file permissions after
copying the data back.

```text
130802 02:58:44  xtrabackup: completed OK!
```

You may need to adjust the file permissions. The following example
demonstrates
how to do it recursively by using **chown**:

```shell
$ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
```

Now, your data directory contains the restored data. You are
ready to start the server.
