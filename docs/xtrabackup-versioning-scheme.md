### Percona XtraBackup 2.4 versioning scheme:

Here is what the numbers in the product version specification mean:

For example, in Percona XtraBackup 2.4.26

* `2.4` - the version of the Percona XtraBackup that is based on [MySQL 5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/) 

* `26` - a sequential number that increases every time Percona releases a new version of Percona XtraBackup 

Percona does not release a new version of Percona XtraBackup 2.4 for every release of MySQL 5.7. Percona XtraBackup 2.4 is compatible with newer versions of MySQL 5.7.
