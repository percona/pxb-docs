### Percona XtraBackup 8.0 versioning scheme:

Here is what the numbers in the product version specification mean:

For example, in Percona XtraBackup 8.0.30-23

* `8.0.30` - the version of [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/) that Percona XtraBackup is based on

* `23` - a sequential number that increases every time Percona releases a new version of Percona XtraBackup

Percona can relese two Percona XtraBackup versions based on the same MySQL version. For example, Percona XtraBackup 8.0.28-20 and 8.0.28-21 are based on MySQL 8.0.28.
