# Accelerate the backup process

## Copy with the `--parallel` and `--compress-threads` options

When making a local or streaming backup with xbstream binary, multiple files
can be copied at the same time when using the `--parallel` option. This
option specifies the number of threads created by xtrabackup to copy data
files.

To take advantage of this option either the multiple tablespaces option must be
enabled (innodb_file_per_table) or the shared tablespace must be stored
in multiple ibdata files with the innodb_data_file_path option.
Having multiple files for the database (or splitting one into many) doesnâ€™t have
a measurable impact on performance.

As this feature is implemented at the file level, concurrent file transfer
can sometimes increase I/O throughput when doing a backup on highly fragmented
data files, due to the overlap of a greater number of random read requests. You
should consider tuning the filesystem also to obtain the maximum performance
(e.g. checking fragmentation).

If the data is stored on a single file, this option has no effect.

To use this feature, simply add the option to a local backup, for example:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ xtrabackup --backup --parallel=4 --target-dir=/path/to/backup
```

By using the xbstream in streaming backups, you can additionally speed up the
compression process with the `--compress-threads` option. This option
specifies the number of threads created by xtrabackup for for parallel data
compression. The default value for this option is 1.

To use this feature, simply add the option to a local backup, for example:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ xtrabackup --backup --stream=xbstream --compress --compress-threads=4 --target-dir=./ > backup.xbstream
```

Before applying logs, compressed files will need to be uncompressed.

## The `--rsync` option

In order to speed up the backup process and to minimize the time `FLUSH TABLES
WITH READ LOCK` is blocking the writes, the option `--rsync` should be
used. When this option is specified, xtrabackup uses `rsync` to copy all
non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a separate `cp` for each file, which can
be much faster for servers with a large number of databases or
tables. xtrabackup will call the `rsync` twice, once before the `FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK` and once during to minimize the time the read lock is
being held. During the second `rsync` call, it will only synchronize the
changes to non-transactional data (if any) since the first call performed before
the `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`. Note that Percona XtraBackup will use
[Backup locks] where available as a lightweight alternative to `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
LOCK`.

Percona XtraBackup uses these locks automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking Data manipulation language (DML) queries that modify InnoDB tables.

!!! note
   
    This option cannot be used together with the `--stream` option.
